### Hey! I'm Wesley Ou!

I'm an incoming Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm building [Instyll Labs](https://instyll.dev/) and was previously at [Exiger](https://www.exiger.com/). I'm interested in natural language processing, UX design, and automation. I love building new things, as evident by my fellowship at [Shad Canada](https://www.shad.ca/).
